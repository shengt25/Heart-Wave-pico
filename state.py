"""
State is a base class for all states.

Every state class must have the following methods:
- enter: called when the state is entered
- loop: called repeatedly until the state is changed

Setting next state:
- To set the next state, call state_machine.set(state_code, args)
- The state_code is defined in the StateMachine class, the data type is int
- The args is a list of arguments to pass to the next state's enter method
